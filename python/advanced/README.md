Python is a high-level interpreted language widely used in research. It lets you work quickly and comes with a lot of available packages which give more useful functionalities.

# Reserve a node with X11 redirection

Due to an issue on iris, you will need a specific script to reverse a node with X11 forwarding. You can clone this script [on jbornschein srunx11 repo on Github](https://github.com/jbornschein/srun.x11.git).

```bash
# Connect to iris using the X11 forwarding
ssh -X iris-cluster
git clone https://github.com/jbornschein/srun.x11.git
# Reserve an node interactively
./srun.x11/srun.x11
```

# Load Python and install required modules in a virtualenv

If you have never used virtualenv before, please have a look at [Python1 tutorial](http://ulhpc-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/basics/).

```bash
# Load your prefered version of Python
module load lang/Python/3.6.0-foss-2017a-bare
# Create a new virtualenv
git clone https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials
cd tutorials/python/advanced/jupyter/
pip install --user virtualenv
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now we need to install all the modules needed. They are listed in the requirements.txt at the root of our tutorial directory. Here is the list of essentials ones:

```bash
# jupyter himself
pip install jupyter
# matplotlib to plot the graph inside your notebook
pip install matplotlib
# ipyparallel for parallel execution of your code on several thread and/or nodes
pip install ipyparallel
# mpi4py for mpi integration in python
pip install mpi4py
# To use our virtualenv in the notebook, we need to install this module
pip install ipykernel
```

To install everything:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now everything is installed properly.

# Create your own kernel and launch your Notebook

In order to access to all the modules we have installed inside your Notebook, we will need to create a new Kernel and use it inside Jupyter.

To do so, let's use `ipykernel`.

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv
```

Now we will have to start our first notebook. To have access to it from the outside, we will need to run it on the correct IP of the node. This simple command permits to start a new notebook with the correct IP. Please ensure that you are running the command inside the correct directory!

The `--no-browser` command is used to disable the openning of the browser after the start of the notebook. We use `--generate-config` at first to generate a default configuration. The default configuration is stored in `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`

To make things easier, we will protect our Notebook with a password. You have just to choose a password after typing the `jupyter notebook password` command. A hash of your password will be stored in the jupyter config file.

```bash
cd tutorials/python/advanced/jupyter
jupyter notebook --generate-config
jupyter notebook password
jupyter notebook --ip $(ip addr show em1 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1) --no-browser
```

At the end of the command, you should see a link like this:

```
[I 17:45:05.756 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /mnt/irisgpfs/users/cparisot/Python2
[I 17:45:05.756 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
[I 17:45:05.756 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 17:45:05.757 NotebookApp] http://172.17.6.55:8888/
[I 17:45:05.757 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
```

Now we need to create an SSH tunneling in order to access this URL on your laptop. We will forward every local requests made on your localhost address of your laptop the cluster. The simpliest way to do so is to type this command if your are on Linux:

```bash
ssh -NL 8888:<IP OF YOUR NODE>:8888 iris-cluster
# In my example, my command will be: ssh -NL 8888:172.17.6.55:8888 iris-cluster
```

Then, by accessing to your local port 8888 on the localhost address 127.0.0.1, you should see the Python notebook.

[http://127.0.0.1:8888/](http://127.0.0.1:8888/).

If you haven't chosen a password to protect your notebook, please append the token to the URL before accessing your Notebook.

# Run our first notebook

* Just click on the Notebook **jupyter/Monte-Carlo calculation of pi.ipynb**.
* Change the kernel for the `venv` one
  * Go onto **Kernel** tab
  * Choose **Change kernel**
  * Select our previously generated kernel called **venv**
* Try to run the code of the notebook in the kernel by using 'Alt-Enter' keys.

# Let's parallelize everything !

## Create your computing cluster

Jupyter offers you an extension that permits to run your notebook code in parallel on multiple cores. To use this extension you have to enable it in your Jupyter configuration file. Do do so, simply run the following command **on a reserved node**.

```bash
# Ensure that your are outside of any virtualenv as you will have to use the
# system Python to run our ipcluster
module purge
deactivate
# Be sure that the following packages are installed
# ipyparallel for parallel execution of your code on several thread and/or nodes
pip install --user ipyparallel
# mpi4py for mpi integration in python
pip install --user mpi4py
ipcluster nbextension enable --user
```

Our Jupyter ip cluster and engine will run on the iris nodes with the default system Python. You have to ensure that you are outside any virtualenv by running the `deactivate` command before.

The cluster comes with various *engines* that allow you to use different resources.

* **local engine**: will use the available cores of the reserved node
* **MPI engine**: will use MPI as a backend to connect to the available nodes. Please be sure that you have loaded a version of MPI (openMPI for example) **before** starting the ipcluster engine.
* **Slurm engine**: will reserve resources via slurm for you and submit jobs for each execution of your code.

### Use MPI engine

You have to ensure that you run our Jupyter notebook on the same node as the ipcluster engine to avoid connectivity issues between the cluster and the notebook. To do we will proceed as this:

```bash
# Reserve a node with x11 redirection and 4 tasks
./srunx11 -n 4
# Begin a screen session
screen
# On the first tab, start ipcluster without any module Python or virtualenv
# we can put the number of workers equal to 4 as we have reserved 4 tasks
# First load OpenMPI
module load mpi/OpenMPI
ipcluster start --engines=MPI -n 4
# Go on screen second tab
Ctrl-A Ctrl-C
# Load your Python version, virtualenv and run your notebook
module load lang/Python/3.6.0-foss-2017a-bare
source venv/bin/active
jupyter [your options]
```

Now if you access to your notebook, you should see a cluster tab that show an MPI cluster running. You can execute the code of the MPI notebook and see that it is working: Jupyter distribute the execution of your code on different cores by using MPI.

### Use Slurm engine

When using Slurm engine, depending on the number of workers you ask for, your script might be executed on different nodes. It means that the engine should be accessible from those remote hosts.

By default, ipcluster engine runs locally and bind himself on the localhost address (127.0.0.1). We have to change this behavior. The easiest way is to use the option `--ip '*'` that will bind the ipcluster engine on all the available interfaces.

You have to ensure that you run our Jupyter notebook on the same node as the ipcluster engine to avoid connectivity issues between the cluster and the notebook. To do we will proceed as this:

```bash
# Reserve a node with x11 redirection
# One task is enough to run the notebook
./srunx11
# Run squeue -u $USER to check that you have 1 interactive reservation running
squeue -u $USER
# Begin a screen session
screen
# On the first tab, start ipcluster without any module Python or virtualenv
# we can put the number of workers equal to the number we need. ipcluster will
# do the slurm reservation for us.
ipcluster start --engines=Slurm -n 56
# Go on screen second tab
Ctrl-A Ctrl-C
# Check that ipcluster engine has made a second reservation for you and that
# the number of cores reserved is correct
squeue -u $USER
# Now you can run your notebook on the same node
# Load your Python version, virtualenv and run your notebook
module load lang/Python/3.6.0-foss-2017a-bare
source venv/bin/active
jupyter [your options]
```

Now if you execute the notebook **jupyter/Parallel Notebook.ipynb**, your code will be parallelize on 2 different nodes using 56 cores!

## Create a profile to store and edit the default options

You can create your own profile to store all the options needed for an experiment. For example to remind ipcluster to reserve a specific number of core or to change/adapt the output of different files.

To create your own profile, type the following command:

```bash
ipython profile create --parallel --profile=IRIS
```

It will create several files in your .ipython directory. For example, to always use Slurm as an engine on iris, you can edit the file `$HOME/.ipython/profile_IRIS/ipcluster_config.py`.

Now just specify which profile you want to use when you start the cluster:

```bash
ipcluster start --profile=IRIS
```

# Use Celery on Iris

## Choose a broker

### Redis broker

We need to run our own instance of Redis server on UL HPC on a node. We will download the executable from redis.io website and execute it locally on a node.

Reserve a node interactively and do the following:

```bash
wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-4.0.9.tar.gz
tar xzf redis-4.0.9.tar.gz
cd redis-4.0.9
make
```

Let's create a configuration file for redis-server with the following options:

* port where the server is listening (default one): 6379
* ip address of the server: we will listen on the main ethernet interface of the node. You can retrieve the IP address with this command `facter ipaddress` or by checking the output of `ip addr show dev em1`.
* we will protect the access to the node with a password to ensure that other experiments doesn't interact with us.

Which gives us the following config file:

```bash
cat > redis2.conf << END
protected-mode yes
port 6379
requirepass yourverysecurepassword
END
```

Now you should be able to run the Redis server on a node with this configuration.

The resources are by default shared with other users. You can't run a redis instance on the same resource (same IP) with the same port number. To avoid collision with other users, you should either reserve a full node to be sure to be the only one running a Redis instance with this IP or if you want to share the IP of your node with somebody else, make sure to use a different port number.

We will run our redis server on a different port number for each run by using this bash command: `$(($SLURM_JOB_ID % 1000 + 64000))`. It will give us a port number between 64000 and 64999 based on the last 3 digits of our job ID.

```bash
srun --pty bash -i -N1 -c1 -J redis-server
./src/redis-server $HOME/celery/redis/redis.conf --port $(($SLURM_JOB_ID % 1000 + 64000)) --bind $(facter ipaddress)
```

You should have the following output:
```
7625:C 24 May 14:06:06.280 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo
7625:C 24 May 14:06:06.280 # Redis version=4.0.9, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=7625, just started

              `-.__.-'                                               

7625:M 24 May 14:06:06.283 # WARNING: The TCP backlog setting of 511 cannot be enforced because /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn is set to the lower value of 128.
7625:M 24 May 14:06:06.283 # Server initialized
7625:M 24 May 14:06:06.283 # WARNING overcommit_memory is set to 0! Background save may fail under low memory condition. To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.
7625:M 24 May 14:06:06.283 # WARNING you have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) support enabled in your kernel. This will create latency and memory usage issues with Redis. To fix this issue run the command 'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' as root, and add it to your /etc/rc.local in order to retain the setting after a reboot. Redis must be restarted after THP is disabled.
7625:M 24 May 14:06:06.283 * DB loaded from disk: 0.000 seconds
7625:M 24 May 14:06:06.283 * Ready to accept connections
```

Now you should be able to connect to your redis server from the other nodes and from the access. You can test it simply with telnet from access.iris. Open a new connection to iris-cluster and type the following command:

```bash
telnet iris-001 64856 # Please replace iris-001 by your node name and 64856 by your port number
AUTH myverysecurepassword
PING
+PONG
^]
telnet> quit
Connection closed.
```

To exit `telnet` strike **Ctrl-]** keys.

## Celery configuration

All information comes from the [official documentation of celery](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/brokers/redis.html#broker-redis)

### Installation

* Reserve a node interactively on iris
* Create a virtual environment
* Install `celery[redis]` inside the virtualenv using pip installer

```bash
si
cd celery
module load lang/Python/3.6.0
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install "celery[redis]"
pip install redis
# (optional) Flower is a frontend for visualization of the queues status
pip install flower
```

### Configuration

We need to give to celery 3 informations about our Redis:
* **password** of the database
* **hostname** of the node on which the server is running
* **port** the port number of the database

As those parameters will change on each run, we will put the 3 value inside a configuration file and import it in the python code to create the broker address which will looks like this:

```python
redis_broker = "redis://:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/0".format(**params)
```

In file `celery.ini`, fill the redis section like this:

```
[redis]
broker_password=<·ª≥ourverysecurepassword>
broker_hostname=<hostname of the redis server that can be find with `squeue -u $USER`>
broker_port=<port that you have defined in the configuration (by default 64867)
```

We have created a list of tasks to execute in `ulhpccelery/tasks.py`. There are 3 tasks:

* add(x, y) add x and y number
* mul(x, y) multiplie x and y
* xsum(numbers) return the sum of an array of numbers

We will start a worker on a full node that will run the code on the 28 cores of iris. For that, reserve a full node and 28 cores, load the virtual environment and run celery.

```
si -N1 -c28
cd celery
module load lang/Python/3.6.0
source venv/bin/activate
celery -A ulhpccelery worker
```

You should see the working starting on the 28 cores and connect to the redis instance successfully. If you have issue connecting to the redis instance, check that it is still running and that you have access to it from the node (via telnet command for example).

### Launch several tasks

From the **ulhpccelery** module, simply reserve a node and execute the following commands.

```
si -N1 -c1
cd celery
module load lang/Python/3.6.0
source venv/bin/activate
python
>> from ulhpccelery import tasks
>> res = []
>> for i in range(10**6):
>>     res.append(tasks.add.delay(i, i+1))
>> for r in res:
>>     print(r.get())
```

You should see the results of the additions. The tasks have been distributed to all the available cores.

### Monitor the experiment

You can use Flower to monitor the usage of the queues.

```
si -N1 -c28
cd celery
module load lang/Python/3.6.0
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
celery -A ulhpccelery flower --address="$(facter ipaddress)"
```

Now, directly access to the web interface of the node (after a tunnel redirection): http://172.17.6.55:5555/

You should see this kind of output:

![Flower interface](./celery/Flower.png)

### To go further

* Try to add / suppress workers during the execution
* Try to stop restart redis server
