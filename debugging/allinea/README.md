_by_ **P. Wohlschlegel (Allinea)**

Developing an HPC application designed for MPI or hybrid environments can be a very challenging task - especially when it comes to fixing bugs, optimizing workload or even resolving both type of issues simultaneously. Those challenges are made easier with Allinea Tools. Using Allinea environment, it is now possible for developers to adopt instantly efficient and scalable development tools and to focus immediately on their core activity : science.

Allinea tools are available for you in University of Luxembourg, and this workshop has been arranged to help you get started with Allinea MAP and Allinea DDT. During this workshop, we will review the capabilities of Allinea tools and see, through hands-on exercises, how this environment can help reduce your time to results to the minimum.
